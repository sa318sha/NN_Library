# READ ME FOR MY LIBRARY

## Personnel NN library by Aleksandr(Sasha) Kobrusev

breastCancer.py is the main program file where it will use a public dataset with 33 different classifier's that will serve as parameters for the model which then evaluates it on certain weights and biasis and train the model to an eventual 95% prediction interval with 10 epochs or 10 trains. the model uses the adam optimizer whihc is a mix of RMS prop and momentum to find the local minimum of gradient descent the fastest possible way. i am aware that other NN libraries do this at a much better and faster way but i did this just to further my knowledge about NN's
